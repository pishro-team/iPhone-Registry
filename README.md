Project: Analysis of the Impact of Registry on the iPhone Market in Iran

Introduction: In today's world, the smartphone market has become one of the key and influential sectors in the global economy. In Iran, with the implementation of new policies, including the mobile phone registry plan, this market has undergone major changes. The implementation of the iPhone registry plan on November 9, 2024, as a major measure to combat mobile phone smuggling and regulate the market, has had a significant impact on prices, supply and demand, and social and economic reactions. This project analyzes and examines the impacts of this plan on the iPhone market in Iran. The project is divided into four sub-issues:

Economic Issues: • Examination of the registry's impact on phone prices • Examination of the impact of exchange rates on iPhone prices • Analysis of mobile market trends before and after the implementation of the registry

Social Issues: • User reactions to the registry plan and categorization of topics

Technical and Legal Execution Issues: • Registry problems from the perspective of users and experts • Meeting market needs (Does the registry plan fully meet the market's demand for iPhones? Is the market sufficiently supplied or does it need more adjustments and reforms?)

Various data from diverse sources such as exchange rate data, market changes, tweets, and user comments have been collected and analyzed. In this report, the actions taken and the analysis method will first be explained, and then the results obtained will be presented in the form of charts and analyses.

Methodology: To carry out this project, an analytical and statistical approach was adopted to accurately and reliably evaluate the effects of the registry plan on the iPhone market. The methodology mainly includes the following stages:

Data Collection: Required data was collected from various sources such as tweets, news sites (Zoomit.ir and Digikala), and economic information related to exchange rates and phones. This data was used both qualitatively and quantitatively to examine the economic, social, and technical impacts of the registry plan.

Data Preprocessing: After collecting the data, the process of cleaning and preparing the data is carried out by reviewing the quality and quantity of the collected data, preparing datasets for the next stage.

Data Analysis: After collecting datasets and using statistical analyses, price and demand changes before and after the implementation of the registry plan were evaluated. Moreover, sentiment analysis was performed on user comments on tweets and sites to examine social reactions to the registry plan.

Modeling and Interpretation of Results: Using statistical models and time trend analyses, various impacts of the registry plan on the market as well as social reactions were accurately examined.
